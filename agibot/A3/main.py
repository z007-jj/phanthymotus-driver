    the third-party compute unit running this driver is also on 10.42.10.x.
    UDP-connect trick: no packet leaves the machine, the OS just picks the
    route's source address for that destination.

    The selected source is validated: on a host with no specific route to the
    robot subnet, connect() picks the *default-route* address (e.g. an office
    LAN 192.168.x.x), and whitelisting that would silently expose domain 42 on
    the office LAN while domain 232 still cannot reach the A3 units — worse
    than setting no profile at all. Return "" unless the answer is a genuine
    10.42.10.x address.

    """Pick this process's single FastDDS profile, before any participant exists.

    Same constraint tianyi2.0 documented the hard way (its main.py
    DualDomainROS2._select_profile): FastDDS reads
    FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE at *participant* creation and caches profiles
    process-wide, so a dual-context driver cannot give the robot context and the
    Agent Core context different profiles — one profile is all the process gets.

    The fleet's loopback-only /opt/phanthy-motus/dds-local.xml would bind every
    participant (including the robot-domain-232 one) to 127.0.0.1 only, and the
    A3's body link is NOT loopback: the HDU/ADU/MDU at 10.42.10.10-12 are
    separate machines reached over eth0. With the fleet profile in force the
    driver would still register over HTTP and look healthy on the dashboard
    while every mirrored topic stayed empty — the exact silent failure tianyi
    measured (visible topics 77 → 33, TTS "succeeding" with no sound).

    So this driver ships its own profile: UDPv4 whitelisted to
    {robot-subnet-IP, 127.0.0.1}. That keeps the body link up (domain 232 via
    eth0) and the Agent Core link up (domain 42 via loopback), while excluding
    every other subnet this host may roam onto. If the robot-subnet IP cannot be
    determined (non-robot host, e.g. a dev machine), no profile is set and
    FastDDS uses its default transports — fine for development, never deployed.
