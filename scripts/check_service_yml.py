"""Check every driver's deploy/service.yml for the DDS isolation contract.

Run this on any PR that adds or edits a service.yml. Exits non-zero on a violation,
so it also works as a CI step.

    ./scripts/check_service_yml.py            # all drivers
    ./scripts/check_service_yml.py unitree/g1 # just one

What it enforces, and why each item is worth a check rather than a README line:

  * the loopback profile is mounted and selected via FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE, unless the
    driver ships its own profile (see OWN_PROFILE — per-participant selection is impossible, so a
    dual-context driver must pick one profile for the whole process). Miss these and the container ends up
    on a different transport from everything else on the machine, so it cannot reach
    Agent Core at all. The failure does not look like "not isolated" — the device
    registers over HTTP and shows up in the dashboard while none of its topics ever
    carry data, which sends you looking at the driver instead of at compose.

  * FASTDDS_BUILTIN_TRANSPORTS is absent. It contradicts the profile's
    useBuiltinTransports=false, and the XML wins, so the variable does nothing except
    tell the next reader something untrue.

  * domain 42, spelled either ROS_DOMAIN_ID or <PREFIX>_ROS_DOMAIN_ID for a driver
    that holds two contexts. There is nothing to allocate here; a different number is
    a mistake, not a choice.

  * network_mode: host. Isolation works by confining DDS to loopback, and containers
    share a loopback only under host networking.

KNOWN_GAPS below is the honest part: a driver whose RMW is CycloneDDS is not covered by
a FastDDS profile at all, and saying so out loud beats letting it pass a check named
"isolation". Those are reported and counted, but do not fail the run.
